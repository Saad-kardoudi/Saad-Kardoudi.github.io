          <p>
            There are many small factors that slowly and gradually harm a
            developer’s projects. They are not immediately destructive. Most of
            them only do long-term damage. Something you won’t see the damage
            for a year or more. So when somebody proposes them, often they sound
            harmless.<br /><br />
            Even when you start implementing them, they may seem fine. But as
            time goes on — and particularly as more and more of these stack
            up — the complexity becomes more apparent and grows until you’re
            another victim of that ever-so-common horror story.
